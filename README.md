<br><h2>1️⃣ About our Program_GYA</h2>
: GYA(Get Your A+)는 학습 태도를 기반으로 본인의 학점을 예측할 수 있는 미니 게임형 프로그램입니다.<br>
: GYA (Get Your A+) is a mini game-based program that predicts one's grades based on their learning attitude.

<br><h2>2️⃣ Used Stacks</h2>
: `Python` & `Idle`<br>
: `Tkinter Library` & `PyInstaller`

<br><h2>3️⃣ About our Codes</h2>
: This program is composed of Python code for a `GUI-based` probability game, where the user selects various study habits and the program calculates the probability of getting an A+.

The code uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. The GUI consists of a canvas with an image and a button to display the result. The check boxes are used to select the study habits. The `click_btn()` function calculates the probability and displays the result in a text widget.

The `resource_path()` function is used to handle the case when the program is run from a temporary folder created by PyInstaller. The function tries to get the system environment variable `sys._MEIPASS` and if it fails, it sets the `base_path` to the current working directory.

The main part of the code creates the tkinter window, sets the window title and size, and creates a canvas with an image. The check boxes and the button are then placed on the canvas. The `BooleanVar()` object is used to create a list of BooleanVar objects, which is then used to create the check boxes. The `click_btn()` function is called when the button is clicked.
